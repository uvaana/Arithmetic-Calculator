#HTML # CSS # Javascript. A arithmetic calculator used to perform a basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subraction, Multiplication and division.
In this project I have used HTML, CSS and little bit of javascript code to perform the arithmetic operation. The calculator design like as same as a original calculator.
